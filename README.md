# Since developers cannot encapsulate Python codes, we did not upload the demo here.
# Once the article is accepted, we will upload all the source code of GraphGST to this project.
# ------------------------------------------------
# Implementation Details:
#
# The proposed GraphGST is implemented with the deep learning library PyTorch. 
# The Python and PyTorch versions are 3.8.10 and 1.9.0, respectively. 
# All experiments are conducted on a Windows server with a GPU (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti).
# ------------------------------------------------
# Our GraphGST model was completed on May 20, 2023. 
# It is a powerful Transformer model designed specifically for hyperspectral data.
# Our manuscript was completed on September 26, 2023.
